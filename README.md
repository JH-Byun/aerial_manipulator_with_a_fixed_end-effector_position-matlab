# Aerial manipulator with a fixed end-effector position: MATLAB simulation
## Overview
<p align="center"><img src="aerial_manipulator_2.PNG" width="400" height="338.5">
  
This repository contains the MATLAB simulation for aerial manipuator with a fixed end-effector position (i.e., plug-pulling aerial manipulator) presented in [1]. The aerial manipulator which is configured with a quad-rotor and a 2-DOF robotic manipulator with a gripper try to pull the plug out of the socket by tilting its body. The results of the simulation can be visualized with various plots and a simple 3D animation video.

## How to run
### Installation
